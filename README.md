# k3s-gitops
GitOps principles to define kubernetes cluster state via code

## Cluster Setup

Check out the [setup instruction](setup) for the cluster and use of this repo. I make the assumption (though its not a requirement) you are using k3s and are not setting up HA. 

## Influence/Source 

This repo is greatly influenced by [billimek/k8s-gitops](https://github.com/billimek/k8s-gitops) and much of the setup scripts/yamls were borrowed or inspired by his repo.
