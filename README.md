# k3s-gitops

Currently re-setting the whole repository to start again with a new rPi based cluster. Will be updated in the coming weeks/months. (02-02-2021)

## Overview

This repository utilizes [Flux2](https://fluxcd.io/) to implement GitOps principals and define the state of my cluster using code. 

## Cluster Setup

New setup instructions forthcoming, pending new hardware being racked in my homelab.
